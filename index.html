    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello. I am Lucy Lauck, a MLIS graduate student at San Jose State University. I am currently working as a barista. I still don't know exactly where I want to end up once I finish my degree, but I am mostly interested in website and database work. While web design isn't all graphics, knowing the rules (and how to break them) is vital. </p>
