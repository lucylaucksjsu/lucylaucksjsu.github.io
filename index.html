      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hello. My name is Lucy Lauck, and I'm a MLIS graduate student at San Jose State University. I am currently working as a barista. I still don't know exactly where I want to end up once I finish my degree, but I am mostly interested in website and database work. While web design isn't all graphics, knowing the rules (and how to break them) is vital.</p>

          <h3>Project 1</h3>
          <p>This is a social media post I made for a fictional Library's Spooky Story Read-Along. I created it using Canva. When I started, I already had a general idea in mind: a Halloween-themed reading event of some kind. I wanted to keep it simple with a limited color palette. The hardest part for me was coming up with what I wanted the text to say. I had a rough idea of what I wanted aesthetically, and settled on the tombstone containing the call to action and the date/time information pretty early on. I thought of the "Boo-k it to the library... if you dare!" first, and had to come up with what event you needed to book it to. I used a "spooky" font called Boo for the headline, and a Serif font reminiscent of the writing found on gravestones for the call to action and details.</p>

          <h3>Project 2</h3>
          <p>To reflect this cozy theme, the fonts I chose to use in this assignment are Balabeloo and Genty Sans and used Canva to create the flyer. I started with choosing a font for the name of the program, which I used Balabeloo for. I wanted something that wasn't too embellished as to be difficult to read, but also not too plain to be visually interesting. Balabeloo is a chunky, round decorative font. It fit the cozy vibe I was going for, and it "says" that this event will be fun and laidback as opposed to serious. The other font I used for the rest of the text is Genty Sans. I wanted a sans serif font to complement the rounded nature of the Balabeloo font, and Genty Sans fit perfectly. It's another somewhat chunky font, which helps make it legible even at smaller sizes or worse image quality. I also chose to use different colors for each font, a cocoa-toned brown for the body text using Genty Sans, and a dusty-rosy pink for the headline using Balabeloo. This helps to make the headline stand out even more as the main focus of the flyer. In the headline itself, "Super Cozy" is a few pts larger than "Reading Party!" to both emphasize it and to make it stand out as what separates it from a regular reading party. I went back and forth a few times between having "Reading Party!" be on one line together, or on two separate lines. I ended up choosing to separate it into two, making for a total of 3 Balabeloo lines, to help distinguish it more from the Genty Sans sections, which are all 2 or 4 lines long. Finally, the colors I chose are meant to be congruent with the graphics I used on the poster, with the pink connecting to the mug of cocoa and the book the right capybara is reading, and the medium-brown being selected from the hot cocoa and the capybara's snouts.</p>

          <h3>Project 3</h3>
          <p>This is a storyboard aimed to walk through how to make a Fall Display for a library or bookstore made using Canva. This storyboard walks through the process of creating the display. It begins with the concept overview: Leaves, Pumpkins, and Cozy Books. The second part involves choosing the color scheme and creating a mood board for the display. The third part is where the real work begins with making signage and decorations for the display. As a separate step, I've included encouraging engagement with a QR code for more in-depth information on the library's website. This could also be replaced with event information or other programs that are related to the theme. The next step involves choosing which books will be featured on the display. Finally, the last step is to assemble the display using all of the previous gathered elements. For creating the storyboard itself, I used Canva and one of the preloaded Storyboard Templates to create the graphic below. I brainstormed ideas in a Notepad file before settling on this. Other things I considered were "Wayfinding Signage Updates" and "Thanksgiving Potluck," but I had more ideas for the Fall Display. I also ended up re-arranging a few of the elements in the storyboard until it felt more cohesive. I originally had a "Plan layout" element, but it felt redundant with the Mood Board and Assemble Display element. I kept the default fault and color scheme since it already fit my fall theme. I kept the captions simple since most of them are self-explanatory or do not require much elaboration. I tend to make and use checklists for any number of tasks in my work, home, and school lives. For example, at work I'll make a checklist of my closing tasks even though I've done it hundreds of times, or I'll make lists of all of the things I want to get done on my days off, or any assignments I need to do and the steps for completing them. It helps me to stay on track if I have a set of guidelines, but I don't usually make it into a graphic storyboard. However, this is another tool in my kit now that will help me in the future whether its planning a display or any other number of things.</p>
