      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hello, my name is Lucy Lauck, and I am a MLIS graduate student at San Jose State University. I am currently working as a barista, but my passion lies in combining graphic design and web development. I believe strong design skills are essential for effective websites because readable fonts, eye-catching headlines, and cohesive color schemes make content both engaging and accessible. I work with tools like Canva and other photo editing software, and I am comfortable with HTML and CSS to bring designs to life online. My approach is holistic, ensuring that every element, from headline to graphics to color palette, works together seamlessly. I have taken web development classes and experimented with personal projects, which have helped me understand both the technical and visual sides of creating digital experiences. I am excited to continue exploring ways to merge design and functionality in meaningful and user-friendly ways.</p>

          <h3>Spooky Story Read-Along Social Media Post</h3>
          <p>This project was created to promote a fictional library’s Halloween read-along event. It was designed in Canva using bold typography, playful icons, and seasonal colors like orange, black, and gray. I focused on creating a visually engaging layout that would stand out in social media feeds. The goal was to capture the attention of young adult library patrons and encourage participation. The finished design demonstrates my ability to balance typography, color, and thematic imagery effectively.</p>

          <h3>Super Cozy Reading Party Flyer</h3>
          <p>This flyer was created to advertise a cozy reading event at a library. Using Canva, I selected a pastel color palette, soft textures, and inviting imagery to evoke warmth and comfort. I emphasized readability and hierarchy so the event details were clear at a glance. The intended audience was library visitors of all ages, aiming to encourage attendance. The final design showcases my skills in composition, typography, and event-focused graphics.</p>

          <h3>Fall Display Storyboard</h3>
          <p>This storyboard was created to guide the setup of a fall-themed library display. Designed in Canva, it uses step-by-step visuals, consistent color schemes, and clear labeling to communicate the process effectively. I focused on creating a logical flow and visually appealing layout to make it easy for others to follow. The target audience is library staff and volunteers who would implement the display. The completed project demonstrates my skills in instructional design, layout, and visual communication.</p>
